## Time Table assistance app version 1
It is a web based application to automatically generate time table. Just for version 1, we are taking input from csv files located on the local file system, however in the final release, we are aiming to link it with the database.

## Design

* If all constraints are satisfied, the time table is generated.
* If any constraint is violated, error message is shown.
